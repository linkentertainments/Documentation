# Dev update

---


## Block Producer Campaign

For last week we are focusing on the DDOS protection. This is a very serious problem when EOS main net comes live. Hackers can shorten the EOS price by attack on the EOS’s main net. In that case, we lose the principle of an open market. We have been working on this problem with several candidates.

## UIP wallet

1. Data tracking of the data server;

2. Wallet server interface documentation;

3. Test optimization of UIP wallet’s official service version:

4. The Android side optimized cache processing of historical records.

5. EOS token transfer test;

6. Ethereum's actual environmental performance tests, including stress testings like UIP/ETH transfer, payment etc.;

7. The second phase needs to implement functional discussions and specific plan making.

---

## UnlimitedIP

1. Android and iOS interface optimization, including homepage news, information modules, real-name authentication and settings;

2. Optimized the interface of Android and iOS, completed the login/registration interface optimization, and debugged the interface related to user data;

3. Android and iOS debugged and optimized the customer service system, abutted the ring customer service system interface, automatically used the UIP account to register a ring letter account;

4. Android Head Portraits selection optimization: read path contains album, file path, dynamic permissions application, which adapted to the latest version of Android 8.0;

5. Android, iOS-based overall business process testing, which achieved test standards;

6. The EOS token smart contract is basically completed and continues to be tested;

7. The EOS node tested the network operation and maintenance, and tested the network security.

# Community  activity

---

1. We have recently collected suggestions from everyone about the daily newsletter and tried to make some changes.

2. This week, based on the research from of Group 11 of former members to share their opinion on Friday, the work of communicating with the original creators (real users of the project) was carried out to understand the original creators' views on the project itself and their real needs.

3. Recently, Group 11 resumed the previous daily conversation. What are the good topics for everyone?

4. The Unlimited Union recently launched a new AA exchange system and task system. Community members can complete the corresponding task through the task system to obtain AA and use AA to exchange in the AA mall.

In addition, the alliance infrastructure and surrounding infrastructure have been completed. Currently, due to the expansion of business scope, it is necessary to recruit core members to operate the alliance. Please send your resume to the Unlimited Union personnel mailbox. We will deposit in the enterprise talent pool and form the alliance management and operation team. Our HR will communicate with everyone about the payroll. The HR mailbox is hr_su@uipu.vip.


>In the end, we know that everyone is very concerned about UIP's price. We believe that as long as the technology is strengthened, it will definitely reflect the value of the platform. All members of the team are constantly working hard for this, and we believe that UIP will attract more investor in the future!
